name: Icons
title: Icons
notes: |
  Dress-code assumes icon font files will be located in the <code>../fonts/</code> directory, relative to the compiled CSS files.
  Moving or renaming those font files means updating the CSS in one of two ways:
  - Change the <code>$dc-font-path</code> variable in the source SASS files.
  - Change the <code>url()</code> path in the compiled CSS.

  Use whatever option best suits your specific development setup.
