    Together with the icon font, Dress Code distribute also the corresponding svg files. Those svg files are used in some components.

    Dress-code assumes that the svg files will be located in the <code>../img/svg-icons/</code> directory, relative to the compiled CSS files.

    Moving or renaming the image folder means updating the CSS in one of two ways:

    - Change the <code>$dc-image-path</code> variable in the source SASS files.
    - Change the <code>url()</code> path in the compiled CSS.

    Use whatever option best suits your specific development setup.
